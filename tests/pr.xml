      <content:encoded><![CDATA[MARCH┬á15,┬á2020┬áΓÇö┬áThe┬áU.S.┬áCensus Bureau┬ácontinues to┬ácarefully monitor the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation and follow the guidance of┬áfederal, state┬áand local health┬áauthorities.┬áWe are adjusting some operations as outlined below with┬átwo key principles┬áin mind: protecting the health and safety of our staff and the public┬áand fulfilling┬áour┬ástatutory requirement┬áto deliver the 2020 Census counts to the President on schedule. ┬á
As of┬átoday, over 5 million┬áhave responded online to the 2020 Census. Currently, the planned completion date for data collection for the 2020 Census is┬áJuly 31, 2020, however, that date can and will be adjusted if necessary as the situation evolves in order to achieve┬áa complete and accurate count.
It has never been easier to respond on your own, whether┬áonline, over the┬áphone┬áor by┬ámailΓÇöall without having to meet a census taker.]]></content:encoded>
